  <h1>About Pulse</h1>
  <p>
  	Pulse is a project of the General Services Administration that measures how U.S. government domains are following best practices for federal websites.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pulse is also an <strong>experiment</strong> built on automated tools, and is <strong>probably not perfect</strong>. Pulse measures domains over the public internet using open source tools, and its results can be reviewed by anyone.

				<h3>
					What does Pulse measure about federal domains?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The first two best practices Pulse is measuring are the use of <a href="/https/">HTTPS</a>, and participation in the federal government's <a href="/analytics/">Digital Analytics Program</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="what-domains-are-being-measured">
				<h3>
					What federal domains are being measured?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Currently, Pulse uses the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data/tree/gh-pages/dotgov-domains">official <code>.gov</code> domain list</a> as a starting point, and focuses on domains owned by federal agencies. This also includes a few domains ending in <code>.fed.us</code>. Domains ending in other suffixes, such as <code>.mil</code> or <code>.us</code>, are not included at this time.
				</p>

				<p>
					Subdomains, such as <code>portal.hud.gov</code> or <code>travel.state.gov</code>, are not measured at this time.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="why-https">
				<h3>
					What is HTTPS, and why does Pulse measure it?
				</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">HTTPS</a> provides a secure connection across the internet between websites and their visitors, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services across the internet. As part of this shift, the U.S. federal government is in the process of transitioning <a href="https://https.cio.gov">entirely to HTTPS</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that HTTPS generally <strong>does not affect</strong> whether a website is vulnerable to hacking. For more information on what HTTPS does (and doesn't do), <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">visit the HTTPS FAQ</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="why-dap">
				<h3>
					What is the Digital Analytics Program, and why does Pulse measure participation?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> is an important federal government project that gives federal agencies and the public a window into how people use government services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any publicly accessible federal website in the executive branch can participate in the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP). The easiest way for federal websites to get started is to <a href="mailto:dap@gsa.gov">send the DAP team an email</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="fresh-data">
				<h3>When was the data last updated on Pulse?</h3>

				<p>
					The list of <code>.gov</code> domains used on Pulse was generated on <strong>{{ site.data.domains | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Participation in the Digital Analytics Program is current as of <strong>{{ site.data.dap | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					HTTPS and TLS data was last collected through a scan of the public internet on <strong>{{ site.data.scan | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</strong>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="send-feedback">
				<h3>
					Where can I send feedback?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The best place to leave feedback or ask questions is <a href="https://github.com/18F/pulse/issues">on GitHub</a>. You can also contact <a href="mailto:pulse@cio.gov">pulse@cio.gov</a> by email.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="my-info">
				<h3>
					Your information about my domain is wrong! Can you please fix it?
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you just changed something about your domain to address an issue on Pulse, be aware that data does not yet automatically refresh on Pulse, and so there may be a delay before your domain's information updates.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you see a mistake, please send an email to <a href="mailto:pulse@cio.gov">pulse@cio.gov</a> and it will be investigated.
				</p>

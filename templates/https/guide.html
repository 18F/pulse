        <h4 id="what-domains-are-measured">What domains are measured?</h4>

        <p>
          Pulse measures the presence, enforcement, and quality of HTTPS for <strong>publicly accessible <code>.gov</code> domains</strong> in the federal government's <strong>executive, legislative, and judicial branches</strong>. Domains which do nothing but redirect to other websites <strong>are measured</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This currently amounts to around 1,200 domains.
        </p>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h4 id="subdomains">What subdomains are measured?</h4>

        <p>
          Pulse currently measures <strong><code>.gov</code> subdomains that are publicly accessible over HTTP</strong> that belong to any of the measured parent domains, that are discovered from <strong>already public sources</strong>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pulse currently draws from two public sources:</li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://censys.io">Censys</a>:</strong>
            Censys publishes a large dataset of <a href="https://censys.io/certificates">observed and issued certificates</a>, updated nightly. This includes all certificates observed on the public internet from daily scans of the IPv4 space, as well as all certificates submitted to public <a href="https://https.cio.gov/certificates/#certificate-transparency">Certificate Transparency</a> logs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://analytics.usa.gov">Digital Analytics Program</a>:</strong>
            The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) publishes <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites.csv">a dataset of federal hostnames</a>, updated nightly. This includes hostnames for which the DAP observed at least one recorded visit in the previous 14 days.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Pulse gathers <code>.gov</code> hostnames from the above sources, and then scans each hostname over the public internet to measure whether it is accessible over HTTP or HTTPS. Pulse only displays results for publicly accessible federal <code>.gov</code> subdomains.

        <h4 id="implementing">Implementing HTTPS</h4>

        <p>
          The process of enabling and enforcing strong HTTPS for a web service can vary widely based on the technology, size, and age of the service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Agencies working on deploying HTTPS are encouraged to consult <a href="https://https.cio.gov">https.cio.gov</a> for detailed best practices and technical guidance. <a href="https://https.cio.gov">https.cio.gov</a> is <a href="https://github.com/gsa/https">open source</a>, and agencies are also very much encouraged to contribute their own expertise and case studies.
        </p>

        <h4 id="measuring">Measuring HTTPS</h4>

        <p>
          Pulse analyzes the behavior of four "endpoints" of every domain: <code>http://</code>, <code>http://www</code>, <code>https://</code>, and <code>https://www</code>. Data from these endpoints is used to characterize the overall behavior of a domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          These measurements are performed using <a href="https://github.com/dhs-ncats/pshtt">open source</a> <a href="https://github.com/18F/domain-scan">tools</a> and the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com">SSL Labs</a> <a href="https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/stable/ssllabs-api-docs.md">API</a>.

        <h4 id="fields">Fields</h4>

        <ul id="uses-https">
          <li><strong>Uses HTTPS</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> No, Yes</li>
          <li>Whether a site can be used over HTTPS, on either its bare domain or its <code>www</code> subdomain. Sites that appear to redirect "down" from HTTPS to HTTP are considered a "No".</li>
        </ul>

        <ul id="enforces-https">
          <li><strong>Enforces HTTPS</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> No, Yes</li>
          <li>Whether a domain appears to "default" to using HTTPS. This can be done either by redirecting its HTTP endpoints to HTTPS, or by only being available over HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul id="uses-hsts">
          <li><strong>Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> No, Yes</li>
          <li>Whether a domain has implemented <a href="https://https.cio.gov/hsts/">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a>, which ensures that <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stricttransportsecurity">supporting browsers</a> will only ever communicate with a domain over HTTPS (even if the user clicks or types in a plain HTTP link).</li>
          <li>"Yes" means that a valid <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header with a <code>max-age</code> value (in seconds) of at least <strong>1 year</strong> (31536000) is present on the domain's default endpoint.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul id="uses-preloading">
          <li><strong>Preloaded (recommended)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> Ready, Yes</li>
          <li>"Ready" means that the domain has implemented a strong HSTS header on its <strong>bare domain</strong> whose policy covers all subdomains, and has indicated consent to <a href="https://hstspreload.appspot.com">preloading by all major browsers</a> as HTTPS-only.</li>
          <li>"Yes" means that the domain is actually in the publicly versioned <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json">Chrome preload list</a>, and has the <code>include_subdomains</code> flag enabled in that list. Reaching this step effectively means that a domain's namespace is permanently and fully committed to HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul id="ssl-labs-grade">
          <li><strong>SSL Labs Grade</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> T, F, C, B, A-, A, A+</li>
          <li>A grade measuring the <em>quality</em> of HTTPS configuration, as calculated by <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com">SSL Labs</a>. SSL Labs operates a free and universally referenced benchmarking service.</li>
          <li>Grades are calculated using a <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/downloads/SSL_Server_Rating_Guide.pdf">detailed methodology</a> that looks at the strength of cryptographic keys, choices of ciphers, supported protocols, and other relevant standards (such as HSTS).</li>
          <li>Grades are hyperlinked to detailed reports for each domain on SSL Labs. As an example, view the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=pulse.cio.gov">SSL Labs report for Pulse itself</a>.</li>
